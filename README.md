# pyz80 extension for Visual Studio Code

## Features

Z80 assembly syntax colouring, plus a wrapper around Andrew Collier's [pyz80 assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyz80/) for the SAM Coup√©.

For convenient use with small projects the extension includes:

* an updated pyz80 from my [GitHub page](https://github.com/simonowen/pyz80).
* **F10** shortcut to assemble the current source file to a SAM disk image
* **Ctrl-F10** shortcut to run the latest disk image
* **Ctrl-Shift-F10** shortcut to send the latest disk image to a networked SAM
* SAMDOS v2 added as the first file in the generated disk image
* generation of a symbol map file compatible with the SimCoupe v1.1 debugger

Larger projects may prefer the extra flexibility provided by Visual Studio Code build tasks.  

## Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version v2.x or v3.x to assemble code
* [SimCoupe v1.1](https://github.com/simonowen/simcoupe/releases) or later to run and debug code with symbols
* [SAMdisk v4](https://github.com/simonowen/samdisk) or later to send code to a networked SAM fitted with a [Trinity](https://www.samcoupe.com/hardtrin.htm) ethernet interface

If these programs are not in your path you'll need to set the appropriate configuration variables.

## Custom Build Tasks

My own build environment often requires more control over the build process than single module building provides. In those cases I use a Makefile under Linux and Mac, and make.bat under Windows. A parameter to make controls how the program is built and run.

The following tasks.json configuration allows this to be used from Visual Studio Code:

```json
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "options": {
        "env": {
            "PYZ80": "${config:pyz80.path}",
            "PYTHON": "${config:pyz80.python}",
            "SIMCOUPE": "${config:pyz80.simcoupe}",
            "SAMDISK": "${config:pyz80.samdisk}"
        }
    },
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "make",
            "windows": {
                "command": "./make"
            },
            "args": [],
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$pyz80"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        },
        {
            "label": "Build and SimCoupe",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "make",
            "windows": {
                "command": "./make"
            },
            "args": [
                "run"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$pyz80"
            ]
        },
        {
            "label": "Build and TrinLoad",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "make",
            "windows": {
                "command": "./make"
            },
            "args": [
                "net"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$pyz80"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

These build tasks can then be bound to keyboard shortcuts in keybindings.json:

```json
[
    { "key": "f5", "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask", "args": "Build and SimCoupe", "when": "editorLangId == pyz80" },
    { "key": "ctrl-f5", "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask", "args": "Build and TrinLoad", "when": "editorLangId == pyz80" }
]
```

You'll still need to provide the guts of the Makefile/make.bat process, of course!
